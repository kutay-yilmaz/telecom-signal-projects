# Telecommunication & Signal Processing Studies

These are my Python scripts to visualize the concepts I learned in Telecommunications engineering. I used Python to simulate signals and calculate RF parameters.

## My Projects

### 1. AM Modulator (`am_modulator.py`)
I wrote this to see how Amplitude Modulation works mathematically.
- Input: Audio signal (Message)
- Output: Modulated wave (Carrier)
- Shows the time-domain graph.

### 2. RF Link Budget (`rf_link_budget.py`)
A simple calculator for the Friis Transmission Equation.
- Calculates Path Loss for GSM (900 MHz) and LTE (2100 MHz).
- Helps to estimate signal strength over distance.

### 3. FFT Analyzer (`fft_spectrum_analyzer.py`)
Using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to find frequencies inside a noisy signal.
- Separates signal from noise.
- Plots Time vs Frequency domain.
